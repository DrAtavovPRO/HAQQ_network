# HAQQ_Network

   Haqq (Arabic for "truth") is a Proof of Stake blockchain network, compatible with the existing ecosystem of blockchain tools and developer tools (primarily Ethereum and Cosmos) and meeting current industry requirements, with high transaction throughput. Haqq aims to serve the international Muslim community by providing a financial and technological tool that enables independent financial interaction.
   
   Haqq is a public network designed to empower a financial ecosystem based on Shariah-compliant ethics. The total issue of IslamicCoin is limited, and 10% of each issue is automatically allocated to charitable purposes. Unlike other similar projects, IslamicCoin seems today to be the most promising blockchain and crypto project for the Islamic world that is both Shariah-compliant and has a Fatwa - [Fatwa (islamiccoin.net)](https://islamiccoin.net/fatwa?lang=arabic) .
   
   IslamicCoin is the community's main crypto-asset. It is used as its own coin in the Haqq blockchain. Each time a new Islamic coin is issued, 10% of the amount issued is credited to a special Evergreen DAO account for further investment in projects for the Muslim community or donated to Islamic charities. Evergreen DAO is a non-profit virtual fund focused on the long term. It operates effectively as a crypto fund. Key decisions are made by a board composed of Haqq network validators, whose contributions to the stability and security of the network are the greatest.
